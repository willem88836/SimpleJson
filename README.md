# SimpleJson
SimpleJson is a simple-to-use Json library.

### Features
  * (De)serialization of one-layer objects (objects that only contain primitives).
  * (De)serialization of multi-layer objects (objects that contain other objects).
  * (De)serialization of objects with multi- and single-level arrays (containing any type of object).
  * Attribute to ignore specific fields/properties of your objects. 
  * (De)serialization of self-referencing objects (or objects that refer to the same object multiple times).
  
### Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to download the SimpleJsonLibary.dll file from [here](https://github.com/willem88836/SimpleJson/releases). 
Import this file into your project, and you're good to go!
For example code, look into the [SimpleJsonTest](https://github.com/willem88836/SimpleJson/tree/master/SimpleJsonTester) project.
